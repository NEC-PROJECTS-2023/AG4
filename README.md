Our project name is YouTube Spam Comments Detection using Machine Learning.This method is used to identify spam comments on YouTube, which has grown significantly
recently. YouTube operates a spam blocking system, although it consistently fails to do so effectively. In order to classify the comments on YouTube, we looked at
similar papers on the topic and applied four different machine learning techniques to data categorization problems (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes ,
Decision tree and Random Forest,).These methods used on the comments from well-known 	music 	videos, 	including 	those 	by 	Psy, 	Katy 	Perry, 	LMFAO.
